## Project Description
The goal of this web application is to assist users in finding a suitable HDB resale flat in Singapore. The data is obtained from data.gov.sg and OneMap via their API. Users can find out how much they will need approximately for buying a flat in the respective towns, the relationship of resale prices and remaining lease years in the various towns and flat type, potential units which are categorised into low, medium and high price to aid users in their selection and more!
